# Learning Marko

I saw Marko in the create-vite framework list and thought: "What's this?"

So I'm playing around with it.

It's a frontend framework like React, with the idea of being an enhanced declarative HTML. Made by eBay. Who knew?

It's different. I like it a lot. It's like Svelte before Svelte decided to become React.
